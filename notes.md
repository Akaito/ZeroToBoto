# Adventure game

Room was created and assigned the Room directly.
	Had to access rooms multiple connections levels down.

Two Room constructor calls with same params; not the same object.

Extra credit: Don't be lazy with "time(s)".

Add hint to last adventure exercise: Keeping track of your current location.

In third extra credit, "NPC" primes to think of a thing in the rooms.
	Maybe mention Mass Effect as reference.

"Hallway" room seems like a connection, not a room, intuitively.
