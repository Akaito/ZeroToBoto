# ZeroToBoto

Learn programming with Python from no experience, up to using the AWS Boto module for some tasks.

[GitHub Pages site](https://akaito.github.io/ZeroToBoto/).


## Possible "course" layout

- [x] Install Python.
- [x] Just print something, and functions.
- [x] Variables, user input, casting str/int, if / while, modules (barely).
- [x] Lists.
- [ ] Pass by "value"/"ref" (really mutable/immutable types).
- [ ] Custom types.
- [ ] Secret keys and S3 upload/download.
	Also AWS account setup.

## TODO

- [ ] guessing-game: Mention how to type check types from within the script (type()).
- [ ] hangman: Have the user's guesses print out in alphabetical order.

- [ ] rpg/classes: Use classes to handle parsing a csv of the encounter?
- [ ] rpg/classes: Think more about boto; what's their justification for classes?
- [ ] rpg/classes: Make each RPG "class" a literal class?  Valid use of classes?

- [ ] Ease the jump from "hello" to "ping, tracert", etc.
- [ ] In first post, link to PEP-8 information.
- [x] Move guessing game post CSS to somewhere centralized.
- [x] Can Jekyll templating make the spoiler sections easier to write?
- [ ] Fix page-footer's empty "maintained by".
