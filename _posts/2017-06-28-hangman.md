In almost any use of programming, dealing with collections of an arbitrary number of things is much more interesting and useful than dealing with single pre-determined variables.
Performing some repetitive task quickly is, after all, one of the main reasons to write any code at all.
Python has a few "[sequence types](https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#sequence-types-str-unicode-list-tuple-bytearray-buffer-xrange)", also often called "collections".
We'll be mostly talking about lists, since they're one of the most generally useful (least specialized) sequence types, and very commonly seen.
Python also has particularly handy syntax for dealing with lists that many other languages don't come pre-built with.

```python
>>> mascots = ['Sonic', 'Mario', 'Crash']
>>> print mascots
['Sonic', 'Mario', 'Crash']
>>> 'Bubsy' in mascots
False
>>> for mascot in mascots:
...     print mascot
...
Sonic
Mario
Crash
>>> mascots.append('Kirby')
>>> print mascots
['Sonic', 'Mario', 'Crash', 'Kirby']
```

Lists are declared with square brackets.
`[` begins a list, and `]` ends it.
Each item within a list is separated by a comma `,`.
You can declare empty lists (`[]`).
Lists are also <em>heterogenous</em>, as opposed to their cousin in most statically-typed languages, arrays, which are <em>homogenous</em> (Python is a dynamically typed language).
This means you can store strings, numbers, etc. together in a single list.

Python provides some niceties like "item in sequence" to test for the presence of something.
Also "for item in sequence:" to enumerate/iterate over each item individually.

As shown above, it's easy to build lists up by <em>appending</em> onto them.

```python
>>> message = 'Hi there'
>>> 'there' in message:
True
>>> for letter in message:
...     print letter
...
H
i
 
t
h
e
r
e
>>> message.append('!')
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'append'
>>> message = message + '!'
>>> print message
Hi there!
```

Strings, being another sequence type (like lists), allow many of the same operations.

Though, <tt>str</tt> is an "immutable" sequence type, while <tt>list</tt> is a "mutable" sequence type.
This is part of why you can't directly append to an existing string, and instead have to create a new string and assign it over the same variable to simulate that.
That's a whole other topic, which you can read a little about [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4677529/chart-of-mutable-versus-immutable-types).
For now, just know that you may have to play around with "foo = foo + bar" versus "foo.append(bar)" for a bit, until you get used to it.

## Exercise: Getting started

A hangman game needs to print out the target word with some letters revealed or still hidden.
Since that's something the game will need to do more than once (as letters are found), write a small function that returns the word with letters hidden or revealed.
Hidden letters will be represented by a period.

```bash
chris@CSU:~/work/ZeroToBoto$ python assets/hangman-0.py 
Word so far: otter
Word so far: .....
```

Your function should look, and be used, like the below example.
We'll worry about individually revealed letters in a moment.

```python
def partial_word(word, revealed):
    # your code here

target_word = 'otter'
print 'Word so far: ' + partial_word(target_word, True)
print 'Word so far: ' + partial_word(target_word, False)
```

### Hints

<ol>
{% include spoiler-hint.html major=0 minor=1
    summary="Per-letter behavior"
    details="
        You want to do something <code>for each_letter in the_word</code>.
" %}
{% include spoiler-hint.html major=0 minor=2
    summary="Building a temporary word"
    details="
        In your function, declare a new <code>partial=''</code>, and append each letter to it.  This will make it easier later to append either a revealed or a shown letter.
" %}
</ol>

## Exercise: Showing parts of the word

Update your `partial_word()` function to expect a <tt>list</tt> of guessed letters instead of a boolean as the second parameter.
Show only those letters "revealed" (guessed by the user).

```bash
chris@CSU:~/work/ZeroToBoto$ python assets/hangman-1.py 
Word so far: .....
Word so far: o..e.
Word so far: otter
```

```python
def partial_word(target_word, revealed):
    # your tweaked code here

# the word that must be guessed
target_word = 'otter'
# a list of the letter guesses made
guesses = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']

print 'Word so far: ' + partial_word(target_word, [])  # writes all periods
print 'Word so far: ' + partial_word(target_word, guesses)  # writes the o and e
print 'Word so far: ' + partial_word(target_word, ['o', 't', 'e', 'r'])  # writes the whole word
```

### Hints

<ol>
{% include spoiler-hint.html major=1 minor=1
    summary="<tt>in</tt> or out"
    details="
        You can either check if each guessed letter is <tt>in</tt> the word, or if each letter in the word is <tt>in</tt> the list of guesses.  One of these may be a much easier way to do it.
" %}
{% include spoiler-hint.html major=1 minor=2
    summary="Choosing a sequence to enumerate"
    details="
        You can either enumerate each letter in the target word, or each letter guessed/revealed, as your \"outer loop\".  Since your main behavior is building an output word that's similar to the target word, enumerate that target word.  Then check on/off behavior for each letter.<br/>
        This would actually be easier to explain in a language where you have to manually enumerate each sequence (target_word and guessed_letters) than it is in the nice world of Python's \"for x in y\" loop and \"x in y\" check.  But it's <em>much</em> quicker and easier to write this code in Python and confirm its correctness by looking at it.  For this program, it doesn't matter a ton which you choose; just do what makes the most sense to you (and works).
" %}
</ol>

---

## Exercise: Getting the hang of it

Make your program take user input for letter guesses, and loop until the user has guessed every letter present in the target word.
If they give zero or many letters in a guess, just ignore it and ask them for a guess again.

This will take significantly more lines of code, but they're largely similar to what you've done already in this exercise and in the guessing game.
As a rough reference, the last completed exercise had about 30 lines (including comments, blank lines, etc.).
This completed exercise has about 60.
Don't think you have to fit that mold, though; that's just an example.

```bash
chris@CSU:~/work/ZeroToBoto$ python assets/hangman-2.py 
Word so far: .....
Guesses so far: []
Guess a letter: a

Word so far: .....
Guesses so far: ['a']
Guess a letter: thisistoolong
Guess a letter: t

Word so far: .tt..
Guesses so far: ['a', 't']
Guess a letter: r

Word so far: .tt.r
Guesses so far: ['a', 't', 'r']
Guess a letter: e

Word so far: .tter
Guesses so far: ['a', 't', 'r', 'e']
Guess a letter: o

Found!  The word was "otter"
  Discovered in 5 guesses.
```

### Hints

<ol>
<li>You can download the completed example and play with it <em>without reading it</em> if you just want to compare behavior.</li>
{% include spoiler-hint.html major=2 minor=1
    summary="Breaking up functionality"
    details="
        You can really do this in whatever way you want.  It makes it easier if you write English first (as comments) for roughly what you know needs to happen.  Then just fill in around the comments with code.  If there's too many lines of text describing an area, that's a good sign you should break it out into a function.  Both because it may be re-usable, and just to make things read a bit nicer.
" %}
{% include spoiler-hint.html major=2 minor=2
    summary="Suggested functions"
    details="
        I added the functions <code>is_word_revealed(word, guesses)</code> (returning <tt>True</tt> or <tt>False</tt>; whether or not every letter in the word has been guessed) and <code>get_letter_guess()</code> (returning a single-letter <tt>str</tt> from the user, after making sure it's only 1 letter long).
" %}
</ol>

## Indexing sequences

```python
>>> mascots = ['Sonic', 'Mario', 'Crash']
>>> len(mascots)
3
>>> mascots[0]
Sonic
>>> mascots[2]
Crash
>>> mascots[3]
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
IndexError: list index out of range
>>> mascots.append('Kirby')
>>> mascots[3]
Kirby
```

You can ask Python for the length (<tt>len()</tt>) of a sequence.
This is the number of items it contains, and doesn't care how "big" each item is individually.

"Indexing" a sequence (`some_list[index]`) is how you get a single item out of it by using that item's offset from the first item (the "head" of the sequence).
So the first item is at offset/index 0, the next is 1, and so on.
This "offset from the head" is why counting in programming starts from 0 instead of 1 in most cases.
The "why" of it makes more sense when you're doing pointer-based work with a language like C++, and it will take some getting used to.
Being used to this makes it easier to move to other languages later.  Lua is the only commmon one immediately in mind that counts from 1 instead of 0 (and many programmers greatly dislike that part of it).

## Exercise: Using a random word

Instead of hard-coding in a single target word to be guessed, pick one out at random from a list.

```bash
chris@CSU:~/work/ZeroToBoto$ python assets/hangman-3.py 
Word so far: .....
Guesses so far: []
Guess a letter: t
 
# ... some interaction later ...
 
Found!  The word was "otter"
  Discovered in 4 guesses.
 
chris@CSU:~/work/ZeroToBoto$ python assets/hangman-3.py 
Word so far: ......
Guesses so far: []
Guess a letter: o
 
# ... some interaction later ...
 
Found!  The word was "orange"
  Discovered in 6 guesses.
```

### Hints

<ol>
<li>Use the <tt>random</tt> module we used in the last week for the guessing game.</li>
<li>Check the <tt>len</tt>gth of your list of words for your upper-bound on randomizing.</li>
<li>Be careful not to hit one of the most common programmer errors: being off by one.  Your random number may be one too high!  (As communicated to you by <code>IndexError: list index out of range</code>.)  Offset/subtract as needed.</li>
<li>Don't overthink the complexity; only the random bounds.  The last completed example and this one have only three functional lines of difference (that is, excluding comments).</li>
</ol>

## Loading data from a file

```python
>>> with open('foo.txt') as myfile:
...     for line in myfile:
...             print line
... 
otter

disambiguous

orange

synapse

toric

```

<a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#open"><tt>open()</tt></a> takes a path to a file, relative to the current working directory of wherever your command prompt was when you invoked Python.
It returns an object (of type `file`) that is a "handle" to that file (now "opened") on disk.

It's bad practice to not close file handles, as that can prevent the file from being freed back to the OS again.
File handles remaining open is why you sometimes can't delete files when they're "in use".
<a href="https://docs.python.org/2/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-with-statement"><tt>with</tt></a> gives us an easy way to make sure our file handle is closed.
The <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#bltin-file-objects"><tt>file</tt></a> type built into Python is a special one that knows to release its handle back to the OS ("close" it) when you leave the scope of the `with` statement it's associated with *by any means*.

While the file is still open, there are a number of operations you can perform on it.  You can read individual lines (`for line in myfile:`), get a <tt>list</tt> of all lines (`myfile.readlines()`), etc.
It's also possible to `open('foo.txt', 'w')` to open a file for writing instead of reading, then `myfile.write()` to it, but we won't need that here.

Note that lines in a file typically end with a line-feed (<tt>\n</tt>), or a carriage-return,line-feed (<tt>\r\n</tt>), depending on your OS (Linux versus Windows).
This is why the above example has extra blank lines (newlines) between each word printed.

---

## Exercise: Using an external collection of words

Note the file with all the words must be in the current working directory of your command line!  Or you have to change your code to look elsewhere.  This is why the example below is run from <tt>~/work/ZeroToBoto/<strong>assets</strong></tt>, whereas previous examples ran from one directory up, telling Python to look in the <tt>assets</tt> directory for the script.

```bash
chris@CSU:~/work/ZeroToBoto/assets$ python hangman-complete.py 
Word so far: .....
Guesses so far: []
Guess a letter: t

Word so far: t....
Guesses so far: ['t']
Guess a letter: r

Word so far: t.r..
Guesses so far: ['t', 'r']
Guess a letter: i

Word so far: t.ri.
Guesses so far: ['t', 'r', 'i']
Guess a letter: c

Word so far: t.ric
Guesses so far: ['t', 'r', 'i', 'c']
Guess a letter: o

Found!  The word was "toric"
  Discovered in 5 guesses.
```

### Hints

<ol>
<li>The <tt>str</tt> type has a useful <code>.strip()</code> method to remove leading/trailing whitespace.</li>
<li>Make a new function; something like <code>get_random_word(dictionary_filepath)</code>.</li>
<li>Make a <tt>list</tt> of words from the file, then treat it the same as you did your hard-coded list of words to pick from in the last exercise.</li>
</ol>

## Extra credit

1. Use the `str` type's `.lower()` method to sanitize both dictionary words and user input, converting everything to lowercase.
2. Try to break your program as a user (numbers, input that's too long or short, non-English characters, ...), and then try to validate the user's input against what you found, so that input doesn't break your program.
3. Read up on, and play around with, [slicing lists](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/509211/explain-slice-notation#509295).  We didn't need that here, but it's a very useful thing to be aware of.
4. In whatever way makes the most sense to you, support guessing the whole word outright instead of always just single letters.<br/>
    If you do, also limit the number of guesses before failing to 9.
