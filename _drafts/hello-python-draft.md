# Hello Python

Preparing to use Python

---

# Installation

Already have it?  Try `python --version` at the command line first.  You want to see something like `Python 2.7.x`.

## Windows

Otherwise, install from [here](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.13/python-2.7.13.amd64.msi) ([GPG signature](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.13/python-2.7.13.amd64.msi.asc)), or an on-site copy of a 2.7 installer if your organization has one.

If you want to use the above signature, get the Python release manager public keys with
`gpg --recv-keys 6A45C816 36580288 7D9DC8D2 18ADD4FF A4135B38 A74B06BF EA5BBD71 ED9D77D5 E6DF025C AA65421D 6F5E1540 F73C700D 487034E5`

## Linux

You almost certainly already have it.  If not, use your package manager.  `apt install python` on Debian-like systems.
